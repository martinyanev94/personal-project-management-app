# Final Project: Build a Personal Project Management Web Application with React

## Objective
The goal of this project is to apply the concepts learned throughout the course to create a fully functional web application using React. This project will challenge students to implement their understanding of components, state management, routing, and API integration.

## Project Overview
Students will develop a Personal Project Management web application that allows users to:
- Create, read, update, and delete projects.
- Add and manage tasks within each project.
- Track the progress of tasks and projects.
- Use routing to navigate between different views (e.g., home, project details).

## Requirements
1. **Technology Stack**
   - ReactJS
   - React Router for navigation
   - Axios for API calls
   - Redux for state management (if applicable)
   - CSS Modules or styled-components for styling

2. **Features**
   - User Authentication (optional for advanced students)
   - Dashboard displaying all projects
   - Project creation form
   - Project detail page showing tasks
   - Task management features (add, edit, delete)
   - Different routing for project and task views
   - (Bonus) Responsive design for mobile and desktop views

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Set Up the React App
- Create a new React application using Create React App.
- Install necessary packages: `react-router-dom`, `axios`, `redux` (if applicable).

### Step 2: Create Components
- **Dashboard Component**
  - Display a list of all projects.
  - Link to create a new project.
  
- **Project Component**
  - Show detailed information about the project and its tasks.
  - Allow adding and removing tasks.

- **Task Component**
  - Handle individual tasks within projects.

### Step 3: Implement Routing
- Set up `BrowserRouter` in the main application file.
- Define routes for the dashboard, project details, and possibly a login page.

### Step 4: API Integration
- Create a simple backend using JSON server or a mock API for managing projects and tasks.
- Use Axios to fetch and send data to the API.

### Step 5: State Management
- (Optional) Use Redux to manage global state, especially if the application will become complex.

### Step 6: Styling
- Use CSS Modules or styled-components to style your components and ensure they are responsive.

## Presentation
At the end of the project, students will present their application, showcasing its features, the functionality, and the software development practices they applied throughout the course.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality: Does the application work as expected?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured and easy to understand?
- User Interface: Is the application visually appealing and user-friendly?
- Git Repository: Is the project properly documented in a Git repository with a clear commit history?

## Conclusion
This project will provide hands-on experience in building a real-world application using React. Students will hone their skills and demonstrate their understanding of the concepts learned through the course.
